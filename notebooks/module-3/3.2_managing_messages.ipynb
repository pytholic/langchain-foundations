Given the extreme conditions of our capital—where temperatures swing from a blistering 120°C to a bone-chilling -100°C—the miners are the backbone of our lunar economy.\\n\\nHere is my official presidential address to the Union:\\n\\n***\\n\\n**\"Citizens of Lunapolis, and specifically, the hardworking members of the ULCMU:**\\n\\nI stand before you today not just as your President, but as a fellow resident of the craters. For too long, the cheese mining industry has been the silent engine of our moon, while our miners have faced the harshest conditions in the solar system. \\n\\nTo the Union, I hear your demands, and my administration is prepared to act on the following \\'Three Pillars of the Crust\\':\\n\\n1.  **Thermal Protection Reform:** It is unacceptable that our miners are expected to extract High-Grade Brie in 120°C heat without state-of-the-art cooling rigs. My first executive order will be to subsidize the new \\'Sub-Zero\\' Exosuits, ensuring that whether you are in the sun or the shadow, your internal temperature remains as steady as a block of aged Provolone.\\n2.  **The \\'Cracker\\' Initiative:** We recognize that the cost of living in Lunapolis is high. We are opening new trade routes with Earth specifically to increase the import of premium crackers and artisanal chutneys. A miner who works the Gorgonzola veins all day deserves a proper pairing at the end of their shift.\\n3.  **Health and Safety for \\'Blue Vein\\' Lung:** We are investing 50 million Lunar Credits into medical research to treat respiratory issues caused by inhaling fine Roquefort dust. No miner should have to sacrifice their health for the sake of the galaxy’s charcuterie boards.\\n\\nThe \\'Great Cheddar Crust\\' of the Southern Pole is deep, but our resolve is deeper. We will not let the industry crumble like a dry Feta. We will stand firm, we will mine deep, and we will ensure that the wealth of Lunapolis is shared by those who actually hold the shovels.\\n\\nLet’s get to work. Stay cool, stay warm, and keep digging.\"\\n\\n***\\n\\n**How would you like to proceed?** \\n*   Should we draft the specific \"Lunar Labor Laws\"?\\n*   Or should we pivot back to the scientific realities of the Moon\\'s environment?', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-3-flash-preview', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019bfd07-f627-73b0-a986-da9c03103558-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 183, 'output_tokens': 1160, 'total_tokens': 1343, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 622}})]}\n"
